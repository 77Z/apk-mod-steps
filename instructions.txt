Open shell.bat, this links to the tools from android studio and steals adb from sidequest.

to decompile and decode the apk run:
	apktool d main.apk

Change whatever you need to in the new folder named after the apk

Repackage the files into an apk:
	apktool b main

new APK is in main\dist\main.apk

align assets in APK to prepare for signing:
	zipalign -p -f -v 4 main.apk aligned.apk
This will make a duplicate of the apk

use the JDK's keytool to generate a keystore:
	keytool -genkey -v -keystore release.keystore -alias example -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
The validity is how long the keystore will be valid for, 10000 is about 27 years

Finally, Sign the APK:
	apksigner sign --ks release.keystore --out thefinal.apk aligned.apk

Your file will be named thefinal.apk and you can install it to a device with USB Debugging active like this:
	adb devices
to confirm the device is connected
	adb install thefinal.apk

And you're done
